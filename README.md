This is a simple reinforcement learning–based navigation project for TurtleBot3.
The agent is trained(TurtleBot3) in an empty  world in gazebo where random goal positions are generated, and the robot learns to navigate autonomously to the goal.

The focus of this project is goal-directed navigation using reinforcement learning, without obstacles, to establish a strong baseline policy.
